# **App Name**: SlideShowPro

## Core Features:

- Slide Navigation: Implement 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons for navigating between slides.
- Content Display: Display text and images on each slide using placeholders. The design makes the content and purpose clear for the user.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the presentation is mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes.
- Interactive Animations: Apply light animations such as fade-in or slide-in effects on each page.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#293B5F) to convey professionalism.
- Background color: Light gray (#E5E7EB) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Soft yellow (#F2E799) to highlight interactive elements and add visual interest.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. 'Poppins' will provide a geometric, contemporary feel to titles, while 'PT Sans' will give a modern and warm appearance to body content.
- Each slide will have a consistent layout, including a title bar, content area, and navigation buttons at the bottom. Placeholders indicate image and text location, to facilitate editing.
- Subtle animations will be used for slide transitions (fade-in or slide-in). These will provide a polished experience.
